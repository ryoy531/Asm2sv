# Asm2sv

Asm2sv is designed to perform gene-level analysis of structural genomic variations that are occurring in flexible manner between distinct genome assemblies. By algorithmic genomic alignment analysis, it analyzes SV in a genome-wide manner then output numeric scores that represent the degree of conservation (or disruption) for all genes. This is based on the expectation that some SVs are not occurring so rigidly as described in conventional variant call format (VCF).
