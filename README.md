# Asm2sv

Asm2sv is designed to analyze structural genomic variations that are occurring in flexible manner between distinct genome assemblies. It performs algorithmic genomic alignment analysis to capture flexibly occurring SV and output numeric scores representing the degree of conservation (or disruption) for all genes. This is based on the expectation that some SVs are not occurring so rigidly as described in conventional variant call format (VCF).
