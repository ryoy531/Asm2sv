# Asm2sv

Asm2sv is a pipeline used to conduct gene-level analysis of structural genomic variations that are occurring in flexible manner between distinct genome assemblies. By algorithmic genomic alignment analysis, it analyzes gene-level SV in a genome-wide manner then output numeric scores that represent the degree of conservation (or disruption) for all genes. This is based on the expectation that different types of SV can be co-exist in a population; for example, some individuals carry 5-kb insertion while other do 1-kb deletion. Because it is difficult to describe and compare such SVs based on conventional variant call format (VCF), we developed the Asm2sv pipeline.
